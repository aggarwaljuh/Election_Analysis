## Election Audit Summary
This code can be used to determine who won an election and where the highest number of votes were coming from. 

A modification can be a more detailed analysis, trying to determine how each county voted. Which means we would determine the rates of each canidate in each county. This is benifical as in the future canidates may be able to do more pointed campaigning. 

This script can be modified to provide other characteristics, instead of just county and canidate. These characteristics can be any form of demographic data (race, sex, age, ect.) or who the individual had previously voted for, assuming that this data is in the original data set.
